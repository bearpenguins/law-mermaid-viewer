You are generating a STANDARDISED Mermaid concept map for LEGAL DOCUMENT ANALYSIS.

STRICT RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE):
1. Output ONLY valid Mermaid code.
2. Start the output with: graph TD
3. DO NOT include explanations, comments, markdown, or prose.
4. DO NOT create placeholder nodes (e.g. "Persons", "Organisations", "Legal Issues").
5. DO NOT invent data.
6. DO NOT output a section unless the document contains real, extractable entities.
7. EVERY node must represent a REAL entity explicitly found in the document.

MANDATORY STYLING RULES:
- Assign Mermaid classes to every node using :::className
- Use ONLY the following classes:

case
person
organisation
legal_issue
event
document
location

- Do NOT invent new classes.


ENTITY TYPES TO EXTRACT (only if present):
- Persons (directors, shareholders, officers)
- Organisations (companies, authorities)
- Locations (addresses, registered offices)
- Legal Status (e.g. Struck Off, Active)
- Events (appointments, filings, strike-off)
- Documents (Bizfile, ACRA filings)

STRUCTURE RULES:
- Use subgraphs for each entity type.
- Node labels must contain real names + key attributes.
- Relationships must be explicit and labeled.

EXAMPLE NODE FORMAT:
PERSON_ALAN["ALAN YEO KENG HUA<br/>NRIC: S1735082Z<br/>Role: Director"]
ORG_ARM["ASIA RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PTE LTD<br/>UEN: 200804657Z<br/>Status: Struck Off"]

RELATIONSHIP EXAMPLES:
PERSON_ALAN -->|Director| ORG_ARM
ORG_ARM -.->|Registered Address| LOC_GOLDHILL

IF the document contains NO extractable legal entities:
Output ONLY:
graph TD
A["No extractable legal entities found"]

Now analyse the following document and generate the Mermaid diagram.
